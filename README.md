**GeoPandas Tutorial Series**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my two-part blog series on GeoPandas, a powerful Python library for geospatial data analysis! This repository contains all the code, datasets, and resources you need to follow along with the blog posts. The Guides can be found here https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/geopandas-tutorial-geospatial-data-handling-and-visualization-0f02e9b23993

### Overview:

**Part 1: Introduction to GeoPandas**
In this introductory post, I cover the basics of GeoPandas, explaining how it leverages the capabilities of pandas and shapely packages for efficient geospatial data handling. Topics include setting up GeoPandas, loading spatial datasets, and basic spatial operations, and map plotting.

**Part 2: Advanced Spatial Analysis with GeoPandas**
Building on the foundational knowledge from Part 1, the second post delves into advanced spatial analysis using GeoPandas. Topics covered include attribute joins, spatial joins, and overlay operations. Practical examples demonstrate how to perform real-world spatial analyses.

### Repository Contents:

- **Part 1**: Contains codes, data, and explanations for Part 1 of the blog series.
- **Part 2**: Contains code and datasets for part 2 of the series

### How to Use:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godwinmurithi/GeoPandas-Spatial-data-Data-Handling-and-Visualization.git
   ```

2. Open the code in your preferred environment.

3. Explore the code, run cells, and experiment with GeoPandas for your own geospatial analyses.
